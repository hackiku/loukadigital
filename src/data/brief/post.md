# Job Description:

Project Overview:
I need an experienced conversion rate optimization (CRO) specialist to optimize my B2B lead generation landing page. The page is brand new (just launched) and I want to implement proven CRO best practices BEFORE we scale traffic, not after.
This is a lead gen page for a Meta ads audit service targeting UK business owners spending $3K+/month on Facebook/Instagram ads.
Current Situation:

Page just went live today
Getting initial traffic from Meta ads
Traffic: Expect 75% mobile, 25% desktop
Current form fields: 2 (email + monthly spend)
Goal: Optimize to industry-leading 8-10% CVR before scaling spend
Tech stack: Built with V0.dev (React/Next.js/Tailwind), but open to migrating to another platform if you have strong reasons

Why I'm hiring now:
Rather than wait to see what converts, I want to implement proven conversion optimization techniques from day 1. I'd rather spend money on optimization upfront than waste ad spend on an underperforming page.

Scope of Work:
Phase 1 (Priority - Must Complete First):

Add specific outcome examples section (mobile-optimized)

Show 3 concrete examples of waste we typically find (with specific $ amounts)
Position strategically before form on mobile
Include brief explanation of each issue
End with compelling CTA that creates urgency


Optimize trust badges for specificity

Change vague promises to specific timelines ("90 seconds to request" not "quick")
Add volume indicators to show activity/credibility
Add specific outcome expectations ("average waste found: $X")
Position where they reduce friction most effectively


Add real-time social proof indicators

Show recent activity/volume ("X audits completed this week")
Recent submission indicators (with realistic timestamps)
Must look authentic and build trust (not spammy)
Optional: Can be static initially, or animated/dynamic if you have experience


Add qualification section

"This audit is perfect if:" with qualifying criteria
"Not for:" exclusion statement to increase perceived value
Position to pre-qualify visitors and increase conversion intent



Phase 2 (Medium Priority):

Add visual proof of deliverable

Show example/preview of what they'll receive
Reduce uncertainty about what they're signing up for
Build trust through transparency


Mobile sticky CTA button

Fixed bottom button always visible on mobile (where 75% of traffic will be)
Smooth user experience with React animations
Significantly improve mobile conversion


Exit intent capture strategy

Desktop + mobile exit intent triggers
Last chance to convert abandoning visitors
Simplified conversion path for those leaving
Must not be annoying or hurt user experience



Phase 3 (Advanced - Optional):

Two-step form implementation

Lower initial friction with multi-step approach
Micro-commitments leading to email capture
Progress indicators with smooth animations
A/B testable against current single-step form


Platform migration (if recommended)

If you believe another platform (Webflow, Framer, custom Next.js, etc.) would perform significantly better, I'm open to migrating
Must provide clear reasoning and expected improvement
Migration would be additional scope/budget




Required Skills:
Must Have:

Proven track record optimizing B2B lead gen pages to 8%+ CVR (portfolio required)
Strong understanding of conversion psychology (social proof, scarcity, specificity, risk reversal, loss aversion)
Mobile-first design expertise (majority of traffic will be mobile)
Experience with React/Next.js/Tailwind OR strong recommendation for better platform
Portfolio showing before/after CVR improvements with actual data/numbers

Strongly Preferred:

Experience with V0.dev or similar AI-generated code platforms
Experience with B2B SaaS, agency services, or professional services lead gen
A/B testing experience and methodology
Understanding of Meta ads / digital marketing industry
Strong copywriting skills for persuasive microcopy
Experience with pages targeting cold traffic from paid ads
Knowledge of when to use different tech stacks for optimal performance

Platform Flexibility:
I'm open to suggestions if you believe another platform would convert better:

Webflow (for visual editing flexibility)
Framer (for animations and interactions)
Custom Next.js (for full control)
WordPress (for ease of future updates)
Other platforms you've had success with

If recommending migration, please explain:

Why it would convert better
Expected CVR improvement
Cost/time to migrate
Long-term maintenance considerations
